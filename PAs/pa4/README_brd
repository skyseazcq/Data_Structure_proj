The board file brd.txt uses the following format to represent the boggle board.

The first line specifies the number of rows on the board, the second line
the number of columns.

Following these two lines there are rows*columns lines specifying the strings
on the board's die faces in row major order: that is, first the entire first
row of the board, then the entire second row, and so on.
